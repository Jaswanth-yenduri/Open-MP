# Open-MP
This Repository contains three sequential and parallel sorting algorithms Bubble sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort using openMP
The program accepts two command line arguments while running, 
	- the size of the array
	- a seed value for generating the random number

the command for running the program should be in the following form:
	[executable file] [size of the array] [seed value]

The program when run with the above arguments prints the time required for that specific algorithm to sort the given number of elements. 
Displaying the elements is commented out on to the terminal as displaying a huge set of numbers is not required and can be uncommented to see the order of numbers before and after sorting.
